Drag and Drop with Local Storage This project demonstrates a simple drag-and-drop interface with persistent data storage using localStorage. Users can add items to boxes, drag items between boxes, and delete items. The state of the boxes is saved in localStorage, ensuring that the data persists across page reloads.
